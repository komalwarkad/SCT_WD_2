🚀 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering | Machine Learning Project 💡

In this project, I implemented K-Means Clustering on mall customer data to segment customers based on:

🏦 Annual Income

🛍 Spending Score


🔍 Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters and visualized the customer segments clearly using scatter plots and centroids.

📊 This kind of analysis helps businesses:

Understand customer buying behavior

Create targeted marketing strategies

Improve customer engagement and retention


💻 Libraries used: pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
